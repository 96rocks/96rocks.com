| Performance on several typical networks: |         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| VGG16                                    | 50ROI/s |
| RestNet50                                | 86ROI/s |
| InceptionV4                              | 36ROI/s |


CNX-soft made a [comparison](https://www.cnx-software.com/2018/01/08/rockchip-rk3399pro-soc-integrates-a-2-4-tops-neural-network-processing-unit-for-artificial-intelligence-applications/) of the NPU performance with popular embedded AI chips as below:

According the official performance from Rockchip, the RK3399Pro beats other high performance SoCs such as Apple A11, Huawei Kirin 970 and even NVIDIA TX2. If this is true, it would be very interesting and exciting since the chips avalability from Rockchips is far more easy that other highend chips.
