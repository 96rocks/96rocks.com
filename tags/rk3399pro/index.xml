      <description>RK3399 Pro update When Rockhip released RK3399 Pro, their first chip with a powerful dedicated NPU up to 2.4TOPs performance, it was told that the release time is August. Apparently they had some delay, and it&amp;rsquo;s the end of Sep now! We recently have some updates from Rockchip that we can start to design boards based on RK3399 Pro now.
Not pin-to-pin compatible We posted on our website that RK3399 Pro was pin-to-pin compatibble with RK3399 and we can upgrade current boards without hardware changes.</description>
